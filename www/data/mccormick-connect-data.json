We must not be satisfied with our past accomplishments and we should make every effort to improve and expand our operations – but only in an orderly and beneficial manner…a company cannot stand still for long – either it goes ahead or it slides back.\" Peter Kiewit, 1964 Excellence. It is the foundation of everything we do. What began in 1884 with two hardworking brothers has grown into a Fortune 500 construction, mining and engineering powerhouse. Kiewit’s ethical, forward-thinking workforce continues to build upon the company’s reputation of safe, high-quality engineering. Consistently ranked among the top five of the Engineering News-Record Top 400 Contractors, our company is a leader in a variety of market sectors throughout North America and, most recently, Australia. As an employee-owned company, Kiewit’s assets are managed by the people who know our work best. For us, business is personal. As our own stakeholders, we’re invested in every project we take on. We continuously strive to build high-quality work at the lowest cost. Our philosophy on safety is simple: Nobody Gets Hurt. Knowing that one lapse in judgment can lead to catastrophic events, the safety of the men and women on our job sites and the community that surrounds our projects is our No.1 priority. Kiewit never stands still. Just as our founders relentlessly chased their dream, we continue to chase new and exciting opportunities, leaving in our wake a trail of jobs done well"],

Before P&G can serve the world's remaining consumers profitably, we can reach them altruistically. We can improve their lives in ways that enable them to thrive, to increase their quality of living and, over time, to join the population of consumers we serve with P&G brands. Through our overall Live, Learn & Thrive™ cause program, initiatives such as Children’s Safe Drinking Water and Pampers 1 Pack = 1 Vaccine are examples of how we are improving the lives of millions of people every day. Our shared Purpose attracts and unites an extraordinary group of people, P&Gers, around the world—the most diverse workforce in P&G history. Together, we represent around 145 nationalities. Our recruiting and development philosophy to \"build from within\" fosters a strong culture of trust and shared experiences. Our diversity, our shared culture and our unified Purpose are the defining elements that enable P&G to touch lives and improve life every day."],

With a demonstrated track record as a company that could \"make great games\", video and software technology, and manufacturing facilities all in place, WMS' foray into gaming was a natural progression for the corporation. WMS Gaming Inc. started out in the video lottery terminal (VLT) business in 1991. The company created, manufactured and placed VLTs in jurisdictions throughout North America. Once successfully established in the video lottery market, WMS Gaming moved into the casino gaming business with the introduction of a video poker game. A year later, the Company unveiled a complete line of technically advanced upright slot machines. In 1997, the company premiered what would be, and still is, its most successful video slot machine to date, Reel 'em In®. This multi-coin, multi-line game offered tons of bells and whistles for the slot player. In an effort to produce an enhanced playing experience, WMS Gaming installed full color high-resolution screens in its games, created full color, detailed graphics, provided an entertaining game theme with many betting options, and increased the hit frequency. These features translated to tremendous player acceptance, increased play and therefore, increased earnings. Since 1998, WMS Industries has been engaged entirely in the manufacture, sale, leasing and licensing of gaming machines. WMS Industries Inc. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: WMS). The Company's subsidiary is WMS Gaming Inc. During the last decade, WMS has become the recognized leader in gaming innovation: •WMS is well-known for creating exciting products with new and unique gaming experiences and leading the way forward based on a clear vision, transcendent innovation and disciplined focus on consistently executing strategic priorities. The gaming industry has evolved and is now on the threshold of exhilarating changes in technologies, new products, new markets and expanded global growth opportunities. •WMS is well positioned to deliver on this future because of its vision and team of passionate, dedicated and diverse people with their proven ability for creativity, innovation and high-performance."],

The treatment process is protected by a pretreatment program to guard against hazardous substances and toxic chemicals. These are strictly regulated pursuant to federal and state requirements. The District routinely monitors all industries and non-residential sources to assure that wastes are disposed of in an environmentally responsible and lawful manner. Treated wastewater, along with runoff from rainfall, enters local canals, rivers and streams that serve as headwaters of the Illinois River system. Stormwater in the separate sewered area is controlled to reduce flood damages by a number of stormwater detention reservoirs. In the combined sewer area, the District’s tunnel and reservoir project has significantly reduced basement backup and overflows to local waterways. Flow within the District’s waterway system and the Lake Michigan discretionary diversion flow are controlled by three inlet structures on Lake Michigan: Wilmette Pumping Station, Chicago River Controlling Works and O’Brien Lock and Dam. The single outlet control structure is the Lockport Powerhouse and Controlling Works. While exercising no direct control over wastewater collection systems owned and maintained by cities, villages, sewer districts and utilities, the District does control municipal sewer construction by permits outside the city of Chicago. It also owns a network of intercepting sewers to convey wastewater from the local collection systems to the water reclamation plants."],
